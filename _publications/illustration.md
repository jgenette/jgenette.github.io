abstract: 'The traditional documentation of phonological systems often relies on (adapted versions of) the IPA. However, such representation does not present information as to whether one speech sound is much more frequent than another one. This type of information might be signalled by brackets, but this gives very little information as to the relative frequency of the different speech sounds. At the same time, the growing availability of phonetically transcribed spoken corpora provides valuable data on these frequencies. Yet, there is currently no easy way to visualize frequency information on the IPA chart. ColouringTheIllustration bridges this gap by allowing users to enhance phonological system documentation through interactive data visualizations. Simply insert the counts of each observed phoneme in your data, and watch as the app transforms your data into insightful visual representations.'
