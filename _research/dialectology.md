Most of my work deals with the description/documentation of the sound systems of the Extreme Southern Italian Italo-Romance dialects, as well as that Walloon varieties in Belgium. I am also interested in the (still unresolved) debate surrounding the origins of Calabrian Greek and how that debate is perceived by the local population.
