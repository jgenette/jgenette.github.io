abstract: "The effect of 15 normalization procedures on the power of statistical tests is assessed. The difference in the F0 in Hz between the high and low vowels (N=1471), i.e. the intrinsic vowel pitch, produced by 47 native speakers of Dutch was assessed by means of a t-test. The same test was applied to the F0 values normalized by means of 15 conventional procedures. The power of the tests was registered to assess the effect of the normalization procedures. The results show that statistical power is influenced by applying normalization, but the difference in power of the procedures is levelled out as a function of the number of observations. The effects of the normalization procedures are interpreted in terms of how the variability of the data is accounted for."
